# New-Tab

![screenshot.png](screenshot.png)

This is my own New Tab extension for Chromium-based browsers, heavily based on [Jaredk3nt's](https://github.com/Jaredk3nt/homepage).

## Installation

Download the repo, either as a `.zip` or via

```sh
git clone https://github.com/sihensel/new-tab.git
```

Navigate to the extensions menu in your browser and tick the switch in the top right corner to enable `Developer mode`.  
Then, click on `Load unpacked` and select the folder containing the repo.

You might want to replace the hyperlinks and the city ID for Openweathermap with your own.
